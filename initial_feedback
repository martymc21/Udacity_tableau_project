Who was most likely to survive on the titanic?
Summary
This titanic dataset contains a subset of information about the passengers aboard the ill fated titanic, I am creating a visualization that shows the traits for the passengers that survived.
Design
I determined that gender, class, and where the passenger embarked from were the most significant factors for survival, and those are the factors I used to create the visualization. I felt that a bar chart was easiest to read which is why I chose it for the visualiztion.
Feedback
Initial feedback:
What does S, C, and Q mean?
What is the significance of the numbers above the bars?
Can you change the color of the bars?
How am I supposed to understand what everything means?
Corrections:
Edited the embarked fields to show the full name of the city the passengers left from instead of the first letter.
Changed the survivor visualization to show the average survivors in each class instead of just the sum.
Changed the bars from all orange to pink for female and red for male
Included explanations of my findings in the story.
Here are links to the first version of my visualization and the final:
